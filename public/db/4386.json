  "description": "**VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED**\n\nBodycam footage has been released of the officer-involved shooting in Tempe that left a 14-year-old burglary suspect dead.\n\nPolice say the burglary suspect shot and killed by an officer Tuesday afternoon was a 14-year-old boy, Antonio Arce, with a replica airsoft gun.\n\nAccording to police, just before 2:40 p.m., officers responded to an alley for a report of a suspicious vehicle.\n\nPolice say as the responding officer arrived at the scene, he observed someone who was in the process of burglarizing the vehicle.\n\nAs the officer made contact with the teen, he exited the car on the passenger side and fled on foot holding a gun, which was later determined to be a replica model airsoft gun.\n\nThe officer chased the boy and gave verbal commands.\n\nDuring this time, police say the officer \"perceived a threat\" and fired his gun, striking the boy.\n\nThe Tempe police chief said Friday in a news conference that the teen was shot in the scapula."
