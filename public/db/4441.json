  "description": "A California rapper was fatally shot after he was found sleeping in a car at a Taco Bell drive-thru.\n\nThe family of the man who was fatally shot is accusing a group of six California police officers of acting as \"judge, jury and executioner.\"\n\nFamily identified the man as Willie McCoy, 20, a local rapper known as Willie Bo, The Guardian reported, and the San Francisco Chronicle reported the family has hired an attorney to investigate whether police were justified in the use of deadly force.\n\nSix officers fired \"multiple rounds\" out of \"fear for their own safety\" after McCoy allegedly reached for a handgun after waking up Saturday night, the Vallejo Police Department said in a statement.\n\n“There was no attempt to try to work out a peaceful solution,” Marc McCoy, Willie’s older brother, told The Guardian. “The police’s job is to arrest people who are breaking the law – not take the law into your own hands. You’re not judge, jury and executioner.\"\n\nFor more on this story: https://bit.ly/2TR9ZbG\nDo you like what you see?
