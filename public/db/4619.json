Stacey, an employee, went straight to the bathroom and when he exited, he fired a single shot from a handgun into the ceiling, telling workers to call the police. Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety Officers Brendan Westrick and Emily Weston entered the building. Stacey raised his gun toward Westrick. Westrick and Stacey exchanged gunfire, Westrick fired 10 rounds at Stacey before he was hit twice in his bulletproof vest and once in the gun holster. After Westrick fell to the ground, Weston engaged the subject firing 13 rounds. Stacey was pronounced dead at the scene. Officer Brendan Westrick was transported to the hospital were he was treated and released. Both officer Westrick and Weston were placed on paid administrative leave per department policy.
