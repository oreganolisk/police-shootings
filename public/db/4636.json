  "description": "Take action at www.lakotalaw.org/justice-for-clarence\n\nOn Sunday, Apr. 14, a 32-year old Lakota man named Clarence Leading Fighter was shot twice and killed by a Rushville, Nebraska sheriffâ€™s deputy in the doorway of a Catholic Church. Now, an eye witness has disputed police accounts of the shooting, saying that Leading Fighter was already incapacitated when he was shot. We want a federal investigation. Please sign onto our action to bring justice for Clarence."
