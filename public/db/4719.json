  "description": "The attorney for the Baytown officer who shot a woman to death after she used his Taser on him, according to police, maintains the shooting was justified.\n\nOn Thursday, Baytown police identified the officer who shot Pamela Turner as Juan Delacruz, an 11-year veteran with the department. Delacruz is on paid administrative leave.\n\nHis attorney, Greg Cagle, told ABC13 Eyewitness News, \"If you disarm a police officer, you're going to get shot.\"\n\nIn an emotional news conference Thursday morning, Turner's family stood with pictures of the 44-year-old in better times.\n\n\"I still can't believe my mom isn't here,\" said her daughter, Chelsie Rubin.\n\n\"She wasn't a violent person. She wasn't a mean person. She was friends with everyone,\" Turner's sister Antoinette Dorsey-James said.\n\nTurner was shot to death by Delacruz Monday night at the apartment complex on Garth Road where she lived. Her shooting and what led up to it was caught on cell phone video.\n\nhttps://abc13.com/baytown-officers-attorney-says-shooting-was-justified/5303539/"
