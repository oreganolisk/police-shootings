  "description": "The St. Paul Police Department released the body camera video of the fatal officer-involved shooting of 31-year-old Ronald Davis on Sept. 15. Authorities say the incident began when Davis rear-ended a police squad car. Both the officer and Davis got out of their vehicles and Davis approached the officer with a knife. He ignored repeated commands to drop it and the officer eventually fired his weapon, killing Davis."
