  "description": "The man killed in a violent encounter with police early Wednesday morning was the son of an NYPD police officer, a law enforcement source tells News 4.\n\nThe incident also resulted in a police officer being shot in the chest after encountering the armed, naked man when he responded to a disturbance call at an apartment building in Manhattan early Wednesday, authorities said.\n\nThe officer, who has not been identified, had been wearing a bullet-resistant vest, and police say that vest saved his life. No other cops were wounded.\n\nNBC 4 New York on Twitter: http://4.nbcny.com/kAuuwUN\nNBC 4 New York on Facebook: http://4.nbcny.com/mbeh714\nNBC 4 New York on Instagram: http://4.nbcny.com/g5YlkcI\nNBC 4 New York on Youtube: http://4.nbcny.com/iTUpy5e\n\n#Police\n#Shooting\n#News\n#NYC\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nNBC 4 New York / WNBC is the flagship station of the NBC Owned Television Stations division of NBCUniversal, serving the New York Tri-State area with an unparalleled commitment to broadcast excellence for more than 75 years.
