The story was posted several minutes before schedule EPD press conference where the below details were released. The narrative included in the news story was addressed in our press conference and was characterized as false.\n\nMan Armed With Hammer Shot by Officerâ€”\n\nOn Monday, October 28, 2019 at 6:28 p.m., an EPD Officer was dispatched to what many would consider a routine call for service â€“ a response to a traffic collision.\n\nA witness to the crash stopped to see if they could render assistance to the driver involved in the collision.\n\nWithin two minutes, an officer arrived and was met by the original witness to the crash as well as two other witnesses. One of the witnesses told our officer that he believed that the driver of the vehicle appeared to be under the influence of some substance.\n\nOur officer approached the wrecked vehicle and found the driver, who has been identified as 45 year-old Terry Wayne Chanley.\n\nChanley was sitting in the vehicle with his door open and appeared to be intoxicated by his appearance and mannerisms.\n\nOur officer asked Chanley for his driver`s license and registration and he just shook his head and began reaching underneath his seat\n\nChanley was given verbal commands to stop reaching for items, which he ignored. Because Chanley continued to reach for items in a suspicious manner disregarding the officerâ€™s orders, the officer backed away in order to give him some distance from Chanley and drew his weapon.\n\nThe officer continued to shout commands, telling Chanley to show his hands. Chanley then grabbed an object appeared to be black, pointed it at the officer and began to move toward him in an aggressive manner.\n\nAt this point, our officer believing that Chanley was armed with a gun and posed an immediate threat to himself and the witnesses that were behind the officer fired his handgun at Chanley.\n\nOur officer began to back away from Chanley while still issuing commands and Chanley continued to advance on the officer in an aggressive manner. Fearing for his own safety and the safety of the witnesses, our officer fired at Chanley again.\n\nChanley still continued to advance on the officer fired a third and final time in order to stop the immediate threat to his life.\nThe EPD believes that our officer acted and performed his duties in a legal, justified, and reasonable manner, taking action to protect members of the public as well as himself from serious injury or harm\n\nI understand that due to the nature of this case and the amount of attention that it has garnered, there is more information that people want to know.\n\nPlease understand that this investigation is still fluid and evolving and that we will share additional information as long as it does not compromise the investigation.\"\n\n\nðŸ”´NEWâž¡VLP NOW ON PATREON:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/VideoLeakPolice\nâœ…My entire channel has been demonetized.
