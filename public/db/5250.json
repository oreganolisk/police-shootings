  "description": "The family of a man shot and killed by Kansas City police last week, met with the county prosecutor Tuesday morning. The family takes issue with the fact that the statement detailing what exactly happened came an entire week after Cameron Lamb was killed. They find that suspicious and they want the officer who used deadly force to be held accountable."
